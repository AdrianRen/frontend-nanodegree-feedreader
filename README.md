# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to finish the Jasmine testing suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## Required Tests (All tests pass)

1. Confirm that the allFeeds variable is defined and not empty

2. Loop through feeds and confirm that each feed url and name are defined and not empty

3. Confirm that menu is hidden by default

4. Confirm that the menu changes visibility when clicked (appears on first click, hides on second click)

5. Confirm that initial entries are loaded

6. Confirm that the content changes when a new feed is loaded

## Additional Tests of existing features (All tests pass)
* Confirm that the first entry element contains entry text and a non-empty url

* Loop through feeds and confirm that content changes for all feed loads (not just first change)

## Tests for Future Features (Test fail)
